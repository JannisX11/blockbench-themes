## Submitting themes

You can submit a theme by opening a Pull Request:

* Create your theme in the Blockbench theme editor. Make sure to enter title and author.
* Export your theme as a bbtheme file.
* Add your theme file to the `themes` folder via Pull Request.

**Please note** that submitted themes need to meet a pretty high quality standard because it will appear directly in Blockbench. Themes need to be unique and pleasant to look at.

Learn more about creating custom themes on the [Custom Themes Wiki Page](https://www.blockbench.net/wiki/blockbench/themes).
